## What is this websites about ? 
* This is one of my biggest project to apply what I've learned through out my learning process to become a developer. The main idea is come from many sources, one of them is a final project from Bootcamp, but don't get me wrong, I only get the idea from them and I have to build, design, set-up database all by myself because I think a social app is something require a lot of skills, effort and many complicated features like authentication system, working with database, not just working with RESTfulAPI, I have to build them with Firebase and test them with Postman, posting Image online dynamically and stored them on a server so you can re-use it everytime the user log in.

## What is so cool about it ? 
* __Dynamic Websites :__ this website change it outlook based on the user logIn
* __Fully-Responsive :__ It work well on both PC, phones with many different platforms and screen sizes
* __Authentication-System :__ Everyone can sign up and log In, This is not just the authentication-system alone but it also have validation 
* __NO-SQL database :__ Firebase database, allow user to get, add, change or delete data and see result immidiately 
* __State Management using REDUX :__ to control a wide range of data from many types : users, posts, notifications, ...
* __Restful API and working with AJAX :__ building a wide range of RESTful API base on the webiste functionality and test them with Postman 
* __CSS__ is built using Material-UI, biggest CSS React library 
* __Using npm__ to utilise many different npm packages based on the needs
* __Firebase deployment__
